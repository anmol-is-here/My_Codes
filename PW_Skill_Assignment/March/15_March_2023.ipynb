    "#### Supervised learning\n",

The objective of the model is to learn a mapping between input features and the corresponding output. The labeled data is used to train the model, and the model is then tested on new, unseen data. The goal of supervised learning is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",

The objective of the model is to identify patterns or structure in the input data. Unsupervised learning can be used for tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

The labeled data is used to guide the learning process, while the unlabeled data is used to improve the generalization performance of the model. Semi-supervised learning can be useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data while using as much of the available data as possible."

    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection to identify patterns or behaviors that deviate from the norm. Anomalies are observations or data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data, and can represent errors, outliers, or fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach to using unsupervised learning for anomaly detection is clustering. Clustering algorithms group data points into clusters based on their similarity, and anomalous data points that do not fit into any cluster can be considered as anomalies. For example, k-means clustering can be used to group data points into k clusters, and any data point that is significantly far from its cluster centroid can be identified as an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, unsupervised learning can be a powerful tool for anomaly detection, as it allows us to identify unusual patterns or behaviors in large datasets without the need for labeled examples of anomalies."
